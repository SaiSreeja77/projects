Project: Bank Customer Churn Model

Objective: Developed a predictive model to identify bank customer churn using SVM Classifier with optimized performance through GridSearch and handling imbalanced data with ROS.

Achievements:
Implemented data encoding and feature scaling techniques.
Addressed class imbalance using Random Over Sampling (ROS).
Conducted GridSearch for SVM hyperparameter tuning.
Compared performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision) for raw, RUS, and ROS data, identifying ROS with hyperparameter tuning as the most effective (Accuracy: 93%, Recall: 98%, Precision: 89%).

Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data distributions, model performance metrics, and comparative analysis plots.

Tools & Skills: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, hyperparameter optimization, data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
